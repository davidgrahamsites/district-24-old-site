                          &quot;the little doctor who loved drunks&quot;, began an indispensable
                          contribution to Alcoholics Anonymous during the early 1930's from his
                          position as medical director of Charles B. Towns Hospital, 293 Central Park
                          West (89th street), New York, N.Y. Towns, founded in 1901, was well known
                          then as a rich man's drying-out place; a rehab for the wealthy, and it
                          served a worldwide clientele. American millionaires, European royalty and
                          oil sheiks from the middle east walked its halls, side by side: brothers in
                          humiliation in bathrobes and slippers.

                        <p align="center" class="style1"><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>It was Dr. Silkworth who told Bill
                            Wilson, during the summer of 1933, of the nature of alcoholism: that, in
                            his opinion, the problem had nothing to do with vice or habit or lack of
                            character. It was, he said, an illness with both mental and physical
                            components. Silkworth is quoted widely as calling the illness a combination
                            of &quot;---an obsession of the mind that condemns one to drink and an
                            allergy of the body that condemns one to die&quot; or go mad if one
                            continues to ingest alcohol.
                            <o:p></o:p>
                          </span></p>
                        <p align="center" class="style1"><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Dr. Silkworth was not the first highly
                          respected authority to write about alcoholism. Solomon, considered the wise
                          man of his era, wrote about it in Proverbs, Chapter 23, and Verses 29
                          through 35. Solomon's Biblical words seem an accurate description of the
                          alcoholic of today.
                          <o:p></o:p>
                        </span></p>
                        <p align="center" class="style1"><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Dr. Benjamin Rush, one of the signers of
                          The Declaration of Independence, was the first member of the medical
                          community to write about alcoholism and suggest it might be an illness. In
                          a medical paper he wrote in 1784, Dr. Rush said he thought alcoholism was
                          &quot;-a disease process.&quot; He offered no further clinical evidence.
                          So: Dr. Silkworth, it appears, was the first medical person to detail
                          alcoholism, in writing, as an illness.
                          <o:p></o:p>

                        <p align="center" class="style1"><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Silkworth, thus, disagreed with his
                          employer, Charles B. Towns. Towns, who had once claimed to have a
                          &quot;cure&quot; for alcoholism, believed firmly in a physiological,
                          medical model of addiction. But, he denied that alcoholism, per se, was a
                          disease. Silkworth argued that certain individuals were
                          &quot;constitutionally susceptible to sensitization by alcohol&quot; and
                          that drinking sparked an allergic reaction. This, he insisted, made it
                          physically impossible for an alcoholic ever to tolerate alcohol. Moreover,
                          he said, that problem drinkers would have to learn and accept this fact as
                          part of their treatment.
                          <o:p></o:p>
                        </span></p>
                        <p align="center" class="style1"><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Silkworth played a major role in many of
                          the early recoveries from active alcoholism, particularly those in

                          . It's
                          estimated that he treated forty-thousand alcoholics during his career. The
                          introduction to his writings in the book, &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;
                          says early AA members considered the Brooklyn-born Silkworth no less than a
                          medical saint.
                          <o:p></o:p>

                        <p align="center" class="style1"><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Dr. Silkworth advised Bill Wilson to stop
                          preaching at the drunks he was trying to help by telling them about his
                          powerful spiritual experience. Silkworth urged
                          <st1:place w:st="on">

                          to begin, instead, by telling each
                          of the alcoholics that his condition was hopeless, a matter of
                          life-or-death. Only then, Silkworth believed, would the drunks be willing
                          to listen to a story about a spiritual remedy.

                          Temperance Biography: From Temperance Reform to Alcohol Research, the 1600s
                          to the 1980s,&quot; the historian Mark Edward Lender lists Silkworth's date
                          of birth as July 22, 1877. All other sources used in this compilation,
                          which contain a date of birth for Silkworth, including his New York Times
                          obituary, agree that Silkworth's birth year was 1873.

                          Silkworth became a specialist in neurology, a domain that sometimes
                          overlaps psychiatry, and entered private practice in the 1920's. It says
                          Silkworth invested his savings in a stock subscription for a new, private
                          hospital. &quot;Pass It On&quot; says Silkworth's investment came with the
                          promise of a staff position when the hospital was built. But, the report
                          says Silkworth lost everything in the stock market collapse of 1929.
                          And,&quot;Pass It On&quot; quotes Bill Wilson as saying that Silkworth, in
                          desperation, went to Towns in 1930 for compensation of about forty dollars
                          a week, plus board.

                          treatment, attending an estimated seven thousand alcoholics. Teddy R., a

                            raised $25,000 for a Silkworth Memorial, to supplement the widow's small
                            income.

                          &quot;medical saint.&quot; To those AA's who knew him, William Duncan
                          Silkworth was a hero. The April 1951 Grapevine article notes, &quot;He
                          freely risked his professional reputation to champion an unprecedented spiritual
                          answer to the medical enigma and the human tragedy of alcoholism.&quot;
                          Historians point out that he might have been laughed out of the American
                          Medical Association for holding such a view. Obviously, that did not

                            Grapevine. And, his affection and sense of personal loss is expressed in a
