    style='color:#993300'>William Griffith Wilson was born in East Dorset,
                              Vermont, on November 26, 1895 to Gilman and Emily Griffith Wilson in the
                              middle of a snow storm and behind the bar of his grandparents' hotel. This
                              inauspicious but curiously suggestive birth would produce the man who
                              decades later both Time and Life magazines would honor as one of the most
                              influential figures of the 20th Century.<br />
                    <br />
                              Bill had a sister, Dorothy, who was four years younger than he. Bill's
                              otherwise happy childhood in rural

                              was shattered when, at the age of 11, his parents divorced. This trauma was
                              accompanied by what he felt was abandonment when his father moved to
                              British Columbia and his mother to Boston where she studied osteopathic
                              medicine and was one of the first females to receive a degree from Harvard
                              University. It was around this time that Bill first experienced what became
                              a series of depressions that he would experience throughout his life.<br />
                    <br />
                              His maternal grandparents, Fayette and Ella Griffith, prominent in the
                              small
                              <st1:place w:st="on">New England</st1:place>

                              younger sister, Dorothy. Fayette doted on his grandchildren. He was
                              especially concerned with Bill whom he realized needed intellectual
                              stimulation and challenges which he encouraged. These ranged from reading
                              literature and teaching himself to play the violin, to the making of a
                              boomerang after Grandfather Griffith told him that no one but native
                              Australians could make and throw one. After a six-month effort, Bill
                              proudly demonstrated to Fayette a bona fide working boomerang.<br />
                    <br />
                              Bill's confidence grew as a high-school student at the Burr and

                              leader and eventual senior-class president. But the unexpected death of a
                              beloved girl he intended to marry sunk Bill into a depression so severe he
                              was unable to graduate. Speaking about this loss years later, Bill wondered
                              how he survived it.

                          were attracted to each other but would not become romantically involved for
                          a few years. Bill eventually enrolled in

                          and Bill one afternoon visited that city's great cathedral. While there,
                          Bill had an ecstatic experience of an overwhelming presence of God which
                          filled and reassured him as no other experience before had ever done. Upon
                          walking through the cathedral's cemetery, he saw to the tombstone of Thomas
                          Thetcher who Bill thought might be an ancestor of his friend, Ebby
                          Thatcher. He was so amazed by the epithet written there, Bill remembered it
                          years later when writing his own story for the book, Alcoholics Anonymous.

                            eventually securing a position in a surety
                            company and taking night courses in economics and law. Bill's potential law
                            career ended when intoxication prevented him from finishing his final exam.
                            (The irony is that years later Bill, being mindful of AA traditions,
                            declined an honorary law degree from Yale.)<br />
                    <br />
                            Bill chose to work on Wall Street and became quite a success providing
                            critical information about companies to brokerage houses. He was drinking
                            at this time, often heavily, but the brokers were making so much money
                            based on what Bill was filing, they tolerated it. However, towards the end
                            of the decade Bill's drinking worsened to the point where it alarmed his
                            wife and business associates who eventually avoided him. When the market
                            crashed in 1929, he knew times would get much harder. <br />
                    <br />
                            In the 1920's, Lois and Bill moved into the home of Lois' parents, Dr.
                            Clark and Matilda Burnham where, a few years later living in the house
                            alone with Lois, Bill would descend into chronic and desperate alcoholism.
                            Considered by himself and others to be hopeless, Bill was visited in
                            November 1934 by Ebby T., an old friend who Bill knew to be a severe
                            alcoholic but who was miraculously sober. Ebby told Bill that he had
                            stopped drinking through his association with the Oxford Group, a spiritual
                            fellowship, and that Bill also could get sober with the help of the group.

                              spiritual fellowship popular in the early half of the 20th century. It had
                              no membership, dues, paid leaders, creed or theology. Its appeal laid in
                              the application of certain principles in daily living namely, honesty,
                              purity, unselfishness and love. Oxford Groupers, as they were called, had
                              success with those trying to stop drinking such as Ebby. When he, an
                              incessant drinker, was sober two months, he went to visit the worst
                              alcoholic he knew to pass on his spiritual experience and its result. That
                              alcoholic was Bill Wilson. They sat at the kitchen table in

                              Stepping Stones) on which Bill had placed gin and pineapple juice, but Ebby
                              refused to imbibe. He had stopped drinking explaining, &quot;I've got
                              religion.&quot; <br />
                    <br />
                              Bill was resistant to Ebby's spiritual program arguing the existence of God
                              and certain religious concepts. But when an exasperated Ebby told Bill,
                              &quot;Why don't you chose your own conception of God?&quot; he could argue
                              no longer and gradually opened to a larger notion of God, of a Power
                              greater than himself. (It was Ebby's statement, translated later in AA's
                              steps as, &quot;God as we understood Him,&quot; that has enabled those from
                              all sorts of religious backgrounds and those without any to avail
                              themselves of &quot;this simple program.&quot; AA is spiritual, not
                              religious, and its member's conception of God is personal and, at times,
                              unique). <br />
                    <br />
                              Although Bill's drinking continued, Ebby's visit opened an avenue of
                              possibility of sobriety. Entering

                              in December 1934, Bill's life was utterly changed by a transforming
                              spiritual experience that resulted in his never needing to take another
                              drink of alcohol for the rest of</span><span style='color:#993300'> his
                                life.

                              Towns psychiatrist William D. Silkworth who believed that alcoholism was a
                              physical allergy to alcohol and not a moral malady. This allergy was
                              triggered by consuming even a small amount of alcohol by some people that
                              caused a compulsion to drink along with a mental obsession to do so. This
                              concept was so new at the time that when Bill asked Dr. Silkworth to expand
                              on it in the Doctor's Opinion for the book Alcoholics Anonymous, Dr.
                              Silkworth did so anonymously. It was only years later, when this theory
                              gained acceptance, did he allow his name to be used. <br />

                              , he was a
                              man reborn. Fired with his &quot;mountain top&quot; experience, he searched
                              the streets and bars of
                              <st1:place w:st="on">Brooklyn</st1:place>
                              looking
                              for others to help. However, despite his ardent efforts to help other
                              alcoholics, his efforts were futile; no one was getting sober.<br />
                    <br />
                              Six months into his own sobriety, Bill and a couple of friends found a
                              small company in Akron, Ohio that was ripe for take over and would pull
                              Bill and Lois out of the severe financial situation. It was not to be. The
                              deal collapsed, probably on stories of Bill's drinking, and Bill, dejected
                              and distressed returned to the city's Mayflower Hotel where he nearly drank
                              again.<br />
                    <br />
                              Tempted by the lure of the bar, Bill headed to the public phone booth
                              instead and desperately sought another alcoholic, someone like himself to
                              talk to. After a series of calls, Bill eventually contacted a Dr. Robert H.
                              Smith, an
                              <st1:place w:st="on">

                              surgeon, and some time attendee at Oxford Group meetings. Agreeing to the
                              meeting only to appease Anne, his wife, Dr. Bob was determined to spend no
                              more than 15 minutes with this man who had a &quot;cure&quot; for
                              alcoholism. The two men</span><span style='color:#993300'> went into a room
                                for what Bob thought would be a quick talk, but he was mistaken. They
                                finally stopped talking about five hours later.

                          and his work
                          there took hold and the movement grew. In the early days, alcoholics
                          participated in the Oxford Group as their means of fellowship and growth.
                          In many cases, alcoholics comprised most of the membership in some groups.
                          In 1937, the growing awareness that an organization of alcoholics-only was
                          needed resulted in the official creation of Alcoholics Anonymous, a
                          fellowship of men and women who share their hope and strength with each
                          other to solve their common problem and to help other alcoholics achieve
                          sobriety.</span><span style='color:#993300'>

                              is the Twelve Steps, a spiritual program of recovery, written by Bill who
                              expanded it from the basic six tenants of the Oxford Group. Bill would
                              later write the Twelve Traditions, a guide to fellowship members on how to
                              avoid the pitfalls to which other groups had succumbed. The traditions are
                              to the groups of AA as the steps are to the individual and are designed to
                              keep AA as a whole vibrant and focused on &quot;our primary purpose.&quot;

                          Bill was 40 years old when he stopped drinking. He would remain sober for
                          the remaining 35 years of his life, spending most of his considerable
                          energy and mental acumen in helping create one of the greatest social
                          organizations ever known, Alcoholics Anonymous. He also would be the major
                          writer of the book, Alcoholics Anonymous, (AKA The Big Book), after which
                          the group would name itself as well as Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions,
                          in addition to numerous articles and pamphlets. <br />
                    <br />
                          In January 1971, Bill was flown in a private jet to the Miami Heart
                          Institute in hopes of finding treatment for his severe emphysema. He is
                          said to have been in good spirits during the flight but much weakened. Bill
                          never received treatment; he died the day he arrived -- January 24th, on
                          his and Lois' wedding anniversary. They had been married 53 years.<br />
                    <br />
                          Bill's last address to the huge annual anniversary party held in his honor
                          in

                          two months before he died was delivered by Lois since Bill was very ill and
                          unable to attend. His message was based on an Arabian salutation --:
                          &quot;I salute you, and I thank you for your lives.&quot; For those in the
                          audience, the sentiment was undoubtedly mutual.
